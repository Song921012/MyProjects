# <span id="head8"> Open Source Software </span>
- Epidemics on Networks (EoN): http://epidemicsonnetworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
 A Python module consisting of over 100 user-functions I wrote for efficient simulation of
epidemics on networks and efficient numerical solution of related ODE models.
 In use in at least 7 universities in Europe & North America.
- Invasion PGF: https://github.com/joelmiller/Invasion PGF
 A Python module I wrote for applying Probability Generating Functions to biological problems
in invasive processes (in particular disease spread).
 Provided along with a 60 page tutorial on the topic.
- Networkx: networkx.github.io
 Contributed algorithm for generating Chung-Lu networks in O(N) time based on my 2011
Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web Graph paper with Aric Hagberg. The
previous best algorithm is O(N2).
 Contributed algorithm for generating random clustered networks based on my 2009 Physical
Review E paper.
 Contributed numerous improvements of speed/memory efficiency for other algorithms, including
global efficiency, configuration model, double edge swap, is connected
 Second highest rated expert on stackoverflow for Networkx.
Refereed Publications (most available at http://scholar.harvard.edu/
