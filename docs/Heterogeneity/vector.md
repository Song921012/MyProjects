# Ideas

Our main interest is that $\tau=\tau(x)$ is a periodic function, with period coincides with the periodic boundary condition. Therefore, there is no constant equilibrium except the trivial solution.  I think we can start to find the kernel function using Fourier transformation, then consider the existece of  non-trivial equilibrium, and proceed about the stability and attractivity.

I am wondering if you can look at this issue, along with Xue and myself. If you can setup a wechat group, we can discuss how this can be moved ahead and schedule some zoom meeting.



## Summary,Current and Future Research
- Tick-borne diseases emerge as a major public health concern;
- Understanding tick population dynamics is essential for interventions;
- Tick population dynamics is better modelled by DDEs;
- Seasonality provides motivations to study periodic DDEs;qualitative theory is not complete yet;

- Spatial movement is also important to introduce multiple delays(diapause vs normal development)(X.
Zhang JW,BMB 2021);
- Tick population dynamics provides motivations for different choices of nonlinearity,giving exciting
examples for new class of dynamical systems;
- Nonlinearity is determined by the density-dependent attaching and grooming behaviors,requiring multi-
scale modeling from infestation and population dynamics,and leading to multi-stability(X Zhang JW,
Proc.AMS,in press);
- Importantly,incorporating disease transmission(both systemic transmission and co-feeding
transmission)provides unlimited challenges for modeling and dynamical systems research(X.Zhang &JW,
in Climate,Ticks and Disease (Pat Nuttall ed.),2021).
