# Ideas

Our main interest is that $\tau=\tau(x)$ is a periodic function, with period coincides with the periodic boundary condition. Therefore, there is no constant equilibrium except the trivial solution.  I think we can start to find the kernel function using Fourier transformation, then consider the existece of  non-trivial equilibrium, and proceed about the stability and attractivity.

I am wondering if you can look at this issue, along with Xue and myself. If you can setup a wechat group, we can discuss how this can be moved ahead and schedule some zoom meeting.
